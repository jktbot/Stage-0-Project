<p> Web pages are text documents written in <em> HTML</em>. <br> 
  Browsers read these documents, interpret them, and then display them.

<b> How Coding Works </b>
<p> Coding is done by programmers who tell computers what to do in specialized languages that computers can understand. Codes give computers intructions that computers can follow and execute. </p>

<b> Computers are Stupid </b>
<p> Computers must be instructed <em> exactly </em> the way computers can understand, or else the program would not work. Programmers must follow specific sets of <em> syntax </em>. </p>

<b> Programmers Can't Remember Everything </b>
<p> There's just too many concepts to learn so it is okay for programmers to look up things they don't know. </p>

<b> Basic HTML Vocabulary </b>
<p> <b> <em> Tags </em> </b> - Tags are always contained within angled brackets < >. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, but some tags don`t have a closing tag. Tags that don`t have a closing tag are called "void tags."</p>
<p> <b> <em> Element </em> </b> - HTML elements refer to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. </p>

<b> <em> Attribute </em> </b> - An attribute is a property of an HTML element.
